    </h1>
    <p>
      Raditz (ラディッツ Radittsu), also known as "Raditz the Runt", is a mid-class Saiyan warrior, the older brother of Goku and the eldest son of Bardock and Gine. He is one of the few remaining full-blooded Saiyans left alive after his homeworld was destroyed. He seeks out Goku in order to recruit him into the Frieza Force to aid in conquering planets.
